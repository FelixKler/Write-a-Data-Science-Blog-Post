### Libraries used <a name="libs"></a>
To run the code seaborn (installing instructions [here](https://seaborn.pydata.org/installing.html#installing) ) and the scikit-learn (installing instructions [here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html) ) libraries should be installed.

### Project Motivation <a name="motiation"></a>
As a part of the Data Scientist Nanodegree Program and as a player of PUBG I'm interested in better understanding different strategies of the game. For this I tried to answer the following questions:

1. Is an offensive way of playing more advantageous than a defensive one?
2. How important is the usage of what items?
3. Is camping more advantageous than a more agile (moving around) game play?

### File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>
There is one notebook with the exploratory data analysis and one extra file with the description of the data.

### Results <a name="results"></a>
The results are provided in the post [here](https://medium.com/@felix.kler/how-to-win-in-playerunknowns-battleground-c7f780dabc38).

### Licensing, Authors, and Acknowledgements <a name="licensing"></a>
For this I have to give credit to kaggle for the data. You can find the any information about the data and corresponding rules of the usage at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/pubg-finish-placement-prediction/overview).
